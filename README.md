## svelte-pdfjs

A WIP implementation of a basic svelte pdf viewer component, reacts to changes in the URL, password, page number and zoom level. All styling is left upto the user.

---
## SvelteKit

It's compatible with SvelteKit, just import the component and use it. No onMount shenanigans required in the consumer since it's already done within the PDFViewer component.
